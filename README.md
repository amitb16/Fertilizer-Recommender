# Fertilizer-Recommender
Developed a crop yield prediction and fertilizer recommendation system using Python. Implemented Random Forest and SVM models for soil classification and yield forecasting, integrated OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data.

As part of my Big Data and Machine Learning project, I developed an intelligent system for crop yield prediction and fertilizer recommendation, addressing critical challenges in modern agriculture. The solution integrates concepts from multiple domains including Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data Analytics, and API integration.
I used Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to perform soil classification and predict crop yields based on key features such as N-P-K values, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The system is trained on synthetically generated and real-world-aligned datasets and evaluates model performance using metrics like RMSE and accuracy.
To further enhance prediction relevance, I integrated OpenWeatherMap API for real-time retrieval of weather conditions including temperature, humidity, pressure, and sky conditions. Fertilizer recommendations are made based on crop-soil mappings using a rule-based lookup from curated datasets.
This project demonstrates my practical skills in Python programming, machine learning model training, evaluation, data preprocessing, and external API usage. It reflects an end-to-end solution that combines predictive analytics with smart recommendations to support sustainable and informed agricultural practices.
